# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a webapp that allows neighbors, friends, and family to show what household items like lawncare equipment, tools, books, camping equipment, etc. they are willing to let others borrow. Any user in the group will be able to browse what items are available to borrow so unnecessary purchases can be avoided.

A lot of people buy things they use only occasionally and then the items just sit there unused most of the time. This wastes money, takes up space, and isn't efficient. If people could easily show what items they have that others could borrow it would save a lot of money and be a more efficient use of things and time.

### Features
- User Login
  - Users will be able to create a profile and login. They will be able to add a contact email for notifications and requests. Their user profile will list their sharing/borrowing history. Passwords will be salted and hashed.
- Create & Edit & View Items
  - Users will be able to add items they are willing to share. Item details will include title, description, picture, availability, notes, category. Users will be able to delete items.
- Browse Items
  - Users of the site will be able to browse items added to the database by user, category, or all.
- Checkout Functionality
  - Users will be able to select an item they want to borrow and an email will be sent to the owner letting them know that they would like to borrow that item. User will be able to specify when they would like the item.

### Technologies
- Java
- Maven
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- Spring Data/JPA/Hibernate
- Thymeleaf templates
- Bootstrap or React

### What I'll Have to Learn

- Maven
- PostrgreSQL
- User Authentication/OAUTH (spring security?)
- Email notification
- Deployment

I have used Gradle and MySQL but haven't used Maven or Postgres so this will be a good opportunity to get familiar with those. I haven't used any OAUTH services so I will need to learn that. I will also need to find a way to handle email notifications. After I get farther along in the app and nail down what functionality the app will have I will have to make a decision about what the best way to deploy it will be. Perhaps I will use Docker as part of a deployment strategy.
